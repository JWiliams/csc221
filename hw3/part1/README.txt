Your lab directory is: /mnt/c/users/jwjjw/courses/csc221/hw3

Inside your lab directory, you must create these directories:

 achar
 adducts
 aquaregia
 daystars
 identificational
 meiosis
 overaggressively
 pyrheliometer
 scattered
 wheeldom

For example:

$ cd /mnt/c/users/jwjjw/courses/csc221/hw3
$ mkdir achar

These directories are random words chosen based on your username.

Each file in your lab directory (e.g. file00001) contains a list of
random words, but each one contains one instance of each of the random
words you used to create your directories.

Each file must be placed in the directory whose name is contained in
the file.

E.g. if the word "achar" is in the file "file00001", then you must move
that file "file00001" into the directory "achar".

$ cd /mnt/c/users/jwjjw/courses/csc221/hw3
$ mv file00001 achar
