## Vim

#### Question 1
The configuration file for Vim is vimrc. In order to do syntax highlighting, one would have to go to the vimrc file and type ":syntax on". This is just one variation of color schemes that vim can provide. Tab managment is done by a series of commands. One is ":tabnew (tabName)", which creates a tab in vim. To go back and forth throught the tabs type "gt" or "gT".
#### Question 2
The best way to extend Vim is probably loading scripts or plugins in the vim directory. Vim does have a plugin system or plugin directory that has to be created by the user in the vim directory that too has to be created.
#### Question 3
According to UbuntuPIT,a technology blog that focuses on modern software and technology advancements, Nerd Tree is the most popular vim plugin. Nerd Tree gives the user easier access to certain strings or data in a huge complex project. The second is Machlt. Machlt lets the user use the "%" key by not just hoping from a open parenthesis to an end parenthesis, but from an if statement to its else if statement.
## Emacs

#### Question 1
The configuration file in Emacs is a .emacs file in the directory. Here is an example of an Emac config file <https://github.com/codemac/config/blob/master/emacs.d/boot.org>. Here is another one that focus on the look or theme of emac <https://github.com/Bassmann/emacs-config>
#### Question 2
The best way probably because it is the most simplest way to me, to install packages in Emacs is by going to the Emacs splash page. Typing the command "M-x list-packages". Here I can scroll and find packages that I can download and even see packages that already came pre-installed in my version of Eamacs. This is their plugin system.
#### Question 3
Jedi auto completes for the user in text editors. It is very recomended for python projects. Ipython is great because it has a terminal interface that also can be food for python projects.
