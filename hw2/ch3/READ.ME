    In this chapter, we begin looking at directories or files, to start, files names in particular.
Of the Lixux Operating system, files name can be troubling because, in that operating system, it is case
sensitive. 
    Next we move on to spaces in file names. Spaces are uses to seperate commands from other commands or
options and arguments, however, if we need to access a file that has a < > in its name, the way to nullify it 
or have the terminal to ignore it, is to put quotes around the name. File name: 2020 Taxes (In terminal: "2020 Taxes").
    Finally we learned about hidden files. One thing to note, is that hidden files has a "." at the beginning of their file
names. When in a directory and we want to see the all the hidden files we must have the option "-a" after our command. 
ex. "ls -a".
