Activity 4
       Right here I had to move around the vi-file using moving commands. I use k,l,j,and h to move up, right, down, and left. I also pressed w and b to forward a word and back a word. 



Activity 5
To delete the whole line, I typed ‘dd’. When I deleted characters, I just type the “x”, but when I had more characters to delete, I will just type the number first and then pressed x. To delete multiple words it is “d(#)w”
