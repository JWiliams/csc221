Activity 1
Start programs from the desktop and use the command ps to get the PID number to kill them once I'm done with it running.
When doing this excercise my applications never were killed. I also notice that PID kept changing for my application I wanted
to close, which could have been normal, but I would not let me close it.

Activity 2
In this excercise I was to do what I did last excercise but this time in another virtual console.
However nothing happen when I type the same command in those consoles.

Activity 3
In this activiy I was to just play around with the sleep command moving processes from foreground and background
