This chapter we learned the command pwd, ls, and cd commands. Pwd is the command we use to describe the path we are 
in. (~/courses/csc221/hw2/ch2) is an example of a path. Ls, the next command we learned, stands for list directory. 
Any time we are in a directory that we would to see its contents, we can type 'ls' and it will print all its directories 
or folders.

Activity #1

In this activity, I am supposed to explore four differnent directories in my system. I was given four recomendations, 
however, I am going to my temp directory, temp/stuff/things, ~, and the place where I am going to save this file (~/courses/csc221/hw2/ch2)
