    In this chapter, we learned what makes up a line of code (most of the time) in a terminal. 
The first thing would be the code (ls or cd), second that follows is arguments (-l/home/ryan).
And usually any argument with a dash, that follows the command, is an option (-l). We also learnd to 
find which directory we are in by using the command "echo $SHELL".
